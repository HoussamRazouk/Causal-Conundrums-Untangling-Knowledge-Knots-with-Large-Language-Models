Time of Check to Time of Use vulnerability in operating system,"['Real-time Systems', 'Concurrency']",False,True,mistral-7b-instruct,mixtral-8x22b-instruct,computer science,"The text describes a vulnerability in operating systems that is related to both real-time systems and concurrency. Real-time systems are present because the Time of Check to Time of Use (TOCTTOU) vulnerability is a concern in systems that require real-time responses. Concurrency is also present because the TOCTTOU vulnerability arises from the race condition between the time of check and the time of use, which is a concurrency issue."
