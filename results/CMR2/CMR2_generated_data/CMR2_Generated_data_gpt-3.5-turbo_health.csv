Chronic inflammation,"[{'Variable definition': 'Inflammatory status', 'Variable value': 'Persistent inflammation'}, {'Variable definition': 'Immune response', 'Variable value': 'Overactive immune system'}]",Chronic inflammation can be an indicator of both persistent inflammation and an overactive immune system.
Metabolic syndrome,"[{'Variable definition': 'Obesity', 'Variable value': 'Excess body fat'}, {'Variable definition': 'Insulin resistance', 'Variable value': 'Reduced sensitivity to insulin'}]",Metabolic syndrome can be characterized by both excess body fat and reduced sensitivity to insulin.
Oxidative stress,"[{'Variable definition': 'Cellular damage', 'Variable value': 'Damage to cells'}, {'Variable definition': 'Antioxidant levels', 'Variable value': 'Low levels of antioxidants'}]",Oxidative stress can result in both cellular damage and low levels of antioxidants.
Hormonal imbalance,"[{'Variable definition': 'Endocrine system', 'Variable value': 'Disrupted hormone levels'}, {'Variable definition': 'Reproductive health', 'Variable value': 'Irregular menstrual cycles'}]",Hormonal imbalance can affect both the endocrine system with disrupted hormone levels and reproductive health with irregular menstrual cycles.
Gut microbiome dysbiosis,"[{'Variable definition': 'Digestive health', 'Variable value': 'Imbalanced gut flora'}, {'Variable definition': 'Immune function', 'Variable value': 'Weakened immune response'}]",Gut microbiome dysbiosis can impact both digestive health with imbalanced gut flora and immune function with a weakened immune response.
Neurotransmitter imbalance,"[{'Variable definition': 'Brain chemistry', 'Variable value': 'Altered neurotransmitter levels'}, {'Variable definition': 'Mood regulation', 'Variable value': 'Emotional instability'}]",Neurotransmitter imbalance can influence both brain chemistry with altered neurotransmitter levels and mood regulation with emotional instability.
Bone mineral density,"[{'Variable definition': 'Bone health', 'Variable value': 'Strength of bones'}, {'Variable definition': 'Calcium absorption', 'Variable value': 'Efficiency of calcium uptake'}]",Bone mineral density reflects both bone health in terms of bone strength and calcium absorption in terms of efficiency of calcium uptake.
Cardiovascular risk,"[{'Variable definition': 'Blood pressure', 'Variable value': 'High or fluctuating blood pressure'}, {'Variable definition': 'Cholesterol levels', 'Variable value': 'Elevated cholesterol levels'}]",Cardiovascular risk can be associated with both high or fluctuating blood pressure and elevated cholesterol levels.
Sleep quality,"[{'Variable definition': 'Sleep patterns', 'Variable value': 'Disrupted sleep cycles'}, {'Variable definition': 'Energy levels', 'Variable value': 'Fatigue and lethargy'}]",Sleep quality can impact both sleep patterns with disrupted sleep cycles and energy levels with fatigue and lethargy.
Stress response,"[{'Variable definition': 'Cortisol levels', 'Variable value': 'Elevated stress hormone'}, {'Variable definition': 'Mental health', 'Variable value': 'Anxiety and depression'}]",Stress response can manifest as both elevated cortisol levels and mental health issues like anxiety and depression.
