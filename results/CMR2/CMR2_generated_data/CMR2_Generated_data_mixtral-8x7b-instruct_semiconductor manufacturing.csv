Interaction value,Variable values,Explanation
Photolithography misalignment,"[{'Variable definition': 'Photolithography equipment condition', 'Variable value': 'Well-calibrated'}, {'Variable definition': 'Wafer handling procedure', 'Variable value': 'Standard'}]","Photolithography misalignment can occur due to a combination of a well-calibrated photolithography equipment but with a non-standard wafer handling procedure, or a poorly calibrated equipment even with a standard handling procedure."
Thin film stress,"[{'Variable definition': 'Deposition rate', 'Variable value': 'High'}, {'Variable definition': 'Substrate temperature', 'Variable value': 'Low'}]","Thin film stress can occur when there is a high deposition rate and low substrate temperature, which can cause uneven deposition and lattice mismatch."
Doping concentration fluctuation,"[{'Variable definition': 'Doping material', 'Variable value': 'Boron'}, {'Variable definition': 'Doping method', 'Variable value': 'Ion implantation'}]","Doping concentration fluctuation can occur due to the use of boron as doping material and ion implantation as the doping method, which can lead to uneven distribution of dopants."
Etching profile distortion,"[{'Variable definition': 'Etchant type', 'Variable value': 'Reactive ion etching'}, {'Variable definition': 'Pressure', 'Variable value': 'High'}]","Etching profile distortion can occur when using reactive ion etching as the etchant type and operating at high pressure, which can cause non-uniform etching."
Crystal defects,"[{'Variable definition': 'Annealing temperature', 'Variable value': 'Too high'}, {'Variable definition': 'Annealing time', 'Variable value': 'Too short'}]","Crystal defects can occur when the annealing temperature is too high and the annealing time is too short, which can cause incomplete diffusion and lattice damage."
Short channel effect,"[{'Variable definition': 'Gate length', 'Variable value': 'Too short'}, {'Variable definition': 'Doping concentration', 'Variable value': 'Low'}]","Short channel effect can occur when the gate length is too short and the doping concentration is low, which can cause reduced gate control and increased leakage."
Electromigration,"[{'Variable definition': 'Current density', 'Variable value': 'High'}, {'Variable definition': 'Temperature', 'Variable value': 'High'}]","Electromigration can occur when there is a high current density and high temperature, which can cause metal ion movement and eventual failure."
Package cracking,"[{'Variable definition': 'Thermal expansion coefficient', 'Variable value': 'Mismatched'}, {'Variable definition': 'Package design', 'Variable value': 'Poor'}]","Package cracking can occur when there is a mismatch in thermal expansion coefficient and poor package design, which can cause mechanical stress and failure."
Yield loss,"[{'Variable definition': 'Process control', 'Variable value': 'Loose'}, {'Variable definition': 'Equipment maintenance', 'Variable value': 'Inadequate'}]","Yield loss can occur when there is loose process control and inadequate equipment maintenance, which can cause variations and failures."
Delamination,"[{'Variable definition': 'Underfill material', 'Variable value': 'Unsuitable'}, {'Variable definition': 'Curing process', 'Variable value': 'Improper'}]","Delamination can occur when there is an unsuitable underfill material and improper curing process, which can cause adhesion failure and separation."
