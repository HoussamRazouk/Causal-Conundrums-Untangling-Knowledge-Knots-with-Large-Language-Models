Interaction value,Variable values,Explanation
gravitational lensing,"[{'Variable definition': 'Gravitational force', 'Variable value': 'bending of light by gravity'}, {'Variable definition': 'Light propagation', 'Variable value': 'alteration in path'}]","Gravitational lensing occurs when a massive object causes a noticeable deflection of light due to its gravitational field, affecting both the gravitational force experienced in the vicinity and the path through which light propagates."
nuclear fusion in stars,"[{'Variable definition': 'Nuclear reactions', 'Variable value': 'fusion process'}, {'Variable definition': 'Stellar energy output', 'Variable value': 'radiation and heat generation'}]","Nuclear fusion in stars describes the process where nuclei combine to form heavier nuclei, releasing energy that contributes to the star's radiation and heat output, thus interacting with the variables of nuclear reactions and stellar energy."
photoelectric effect,"[{'Variable definition': 'Electromagnetic radiation interaction', 'Variable value': 'light absorption'}, {'Variable definition': 'Electron emission', 'Variable value': 'release of electrons'}]","The photoelectric effect occurs when light is absorbed by a material causing it to emit electrons, thus linking the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with a material and the subsequent electron emission."
thermoelectric cooling,"[{'Variable definition': 'Heat transfer', 'Variable value': 'heat absorption'}, {'Variable definition': 'Electrical effects', 'Variable value': 'voltage application'}]","Thermoelectric cooling involves the application of a voltage to create a temperature difference by absorbing heat from one area and dissipating it in another, thereby interacting with both heat transfer and electrical effects."
superconductivity,"[{'Variable definition': 'Electrical resistance', 'Variable value': 'zero resistance'}, {'Variable definition': 'Material phase', 'Variable value': 'condensed matter state'}]","Superconductivity is a phenomenon where materials exhibit zero electrical resistance and expel magnetic fields when cooled below a certain temperature, affecting both the electrical resistance and the phase state of the material."
black hole evaporation,"[{'Variable definition': 'Black hole properties', 'Variable value': 'mass decrease'}, {'Variable definition': 'Quantum effects', 'Variable value': 'Hawking radiation emission'}]","Black hole evaporation describes the process by which black holes lose mass through the emission of Hawking radiation, a quantum mechanical effect, thus linking the properties of black holes with quantum phenomena."
solar wind interaction with Earth's magnetosphere,"[{'Variable definition': 'Solar activity', 'Variable value': 'emission of charged particles'}, {'Variable definition': 'Geomagnetic effects', 'Variable value': 'magnetic field disturbances'}]","The interaction of solar wind with Earth's magnetosphere involves the solar emission of charged particles that disturb Earth's magnetic field, impacting both solar activity and geomagnetic conditions."
elastic collision of particles,"[{'Variable definition': 'Momentum conservation', 'Variable value': 'momentum exchange'}, {'Variable definition': 'Kinetic energy conservation', 'Variable value': 'energy retention'}]","An elastic collision is a type of collision where there is no net loss in kinetic energy in the system, and momentum is conserved through the exchange between colliding particles."
semiconductor doping,"[{'Variable definition': 'Material conductivity', 'Variable value': 'conductivity enhancement'}, {'Variable definition': 'Material composition', 'Variable value': 'impurity addition'}]","Semiconductor doping involves adding impurities to a pure semiconductor to enhance its electrical conductivity, thereby affecting both the material's composition and its conductivity properties."
gamma-ray burst emissions,"[{'Variable definition': 'High-energy astrophysical phenomena', 'Variable value': 'high-energy radiation release'}, {'Variable definition': 'Stellar evolution', 'Variable value': 'massive star collapse or merger'}]","Gamma-ray bursts are extremely energetic explosions observed in distant galaxies, often associated with the collapse of massive stars or mergers, linking high-energy astrophysical phenomena with processes in stellar evolution."
