Interaction value,Variable values,Explanation
Concurrent CPU and RAM usage,"[{'Variable definition': 'CPU usage', 'Variable value': '30%'}, {'Variable definition': 'RAM usage', 'Variable value': '50%'}]","This interaction value represents the simultaneous usage of the CPU and RAM, where the CPU is used at 30% capacity and the RAM is used at 50% capacity."
Encryption strength,"[{'Variable definition': 'Algorithm complexity', 'Variable value': 'AES-256'}, {'Variable definition': 'Key length', 'Variable value': '2048 bits'}]","This interaction value represents the encryption strength, which is determined by both the algorithm complexity (AES-256) and the key length (2048 bits)."
Network latency,"[{'Variable definition': 'Round-trip time', 'Variable value': '15 ms'}, {'Variable definition': 'Packet loss', 'Variable value': '2%'}]","This interaction value represents the network latency, which consists of the round-trip time (15 ms) and the packet loss (2%)."
Data transfer rate,"[{'Variable definition': 'Data volume', 'Variable value': '10 GB'}, {'Variable definition': 'Transfer time', 'Variable value': '2 hours'}]","This interaction value represents the data transfer rate, which is calculated by dividing the data volume (10 GB) by the transfer time (2 hours)."
Software version,"[{'Variable definition': 'Major release', 'Variable value': '3.0'}, {'Variable definition': 'Minor release', 'Variable value': '1'}]","This interaction value represents the software version, which is denoted by the major release (3.0) and the minor release (1)."
API request,"[{'Variable definition': 'Endpoint', 'Variable value': '/users'}, {'Variable definition': 'HTTP method', 'Variable value': 'GET'}]","This interaction value represents an API request, which consists of the endpoint (/users) and the HTTP method (GET)."
File compression,"[{'Variable definition': 'Original file size', 'Variable value': '50 MB'}, {'Variable definition': 'Compressed file size', 'Variable value': '15 MB'}]","This interaction value represents the file compression, which is indicated by the original file size (50 MB) and the compressed file size (15 MB)."
Disk usage,"[{'Variable definition': 'Used disk space', 'Variable value': '80 GB'}, {'Variable definition': 'Total disk space', 'Variable value': '1 TB'}]","This interaction value represents the disk usage, which is calculated by dividing the used disk space (80 GB) by the total disk space (1 TB)."
GPU performance,"[{'Variable definition': 'Clock speed', 'Variable value': '1.8 GHz'}, {'Variable definition': 'Memory size', 'Variable value': '8 GB'}]","This interaction value represents the GPU performance, which is determined by the clock speed (1.8 GHz) and the memory size (8 GB)."
Code quality,"[{'Variable definition': 'Code coverage', 'Variable value': '90%'}, {'Variable definition': 'Code complexity', 'Variable value': 'Low'}]","This interaction value represents the code quality, which is evaluated by the code coverage (90%) and the code complexity (Low)."
