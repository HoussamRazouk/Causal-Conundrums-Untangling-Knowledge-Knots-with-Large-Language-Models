Interaction value,Variable values,Explanation
Electromagnetic induction,"[{'Variable definition': 'Magnetic field', 'Variable value': 'Changing magnetic field'}, {'Variable definition': 'Electric field', 'Variable value': 'Induced electric field'}]","Electromagnetic induction represents the changing magnetic field, which induces an electric field, thus representing the values of both magnetic and electric fields simultaneously."
Superconductivity,"[{'Variable definition': 'Electrical resistance', 'Variable value': 'Zero electrical resistance'}, {'Variable definition': 'Temperature', 'Variable value': 'Below critical temperature'}]","Superconductivity represents the state of zero electrical resistance at temperatures below the critical temperature, thus representing the values of both electrical resistance and temperature simultaneously."
Quantum entanglement,"[{'Variable definition': 'Particle state', 'Variable value': 'Interconnected particle states'}, {'Variable definition': 'Particle separation', 'Variable value': 'Arbitrary separation distance'}]","Quantum entanglement represents the interconnected states of particles, regardless of the arbitrary separation distance between them, thus representing the values of both particle state and separation simultaneously."
Black hole event horizon,"[{'Variable definition': 'Gravitational force', 'Variable value': 'Extremely strong gravitational force'}, {'Variable definition': 'Escape velocity', 'Variable value': 'Equal to the speed of light'}]","The black hole event horizon represents an extremely strong gravitational force, where the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light, thus representing the values of both gravitational force and escape velocity simultaneously."
Wave-particle duality,"[{'Variable definition': 'Light behavior', 'Variable value': 'Exhibits both wave and particle properties'}]","Wave-particle duality represents the behavior of light, which exhibits both wave and particle properties, thus representing the values of light behavior simultaneously."
Nuclear fission,"[{'Variable definition': 'Nuclear reaction', 'Variable value': 'Heavy nucleus splitting'}, {'Variable definition': 'Energy release', 'Variable value': 'Large amount of energy released'}]","Nuclear fission represents the splitting of a heavy nucleus, which releases a large amount of energy, thus representing the values of both nuclear reaction and energy release simultaneously."
Quantum tunneling,"[{'Variable definition': 'Particle behavior', 'Variable value': 'Particle passing through a potential barrier'}, {'Variable definition': 'Probability', 'Variable value': 'Non-zero probability of occurrence'}]","Quantum tunneling represents the behavior of particles passing through a potential barrier, which has a non-zero probability of occurrence, thus representing the values of both particle behavior and probability simultaneously."
Special relativity,"[{'Variable definition': 'Space and time', 'Variable value': 'Interconnected space and time'}, {'Variable definition': 'Speed of light', 'Variable value': 'Constant speed of light'}]","Special relativity represents the interconnected nature of space and time, where the speed of light is constant, thus representing the values of both space and time, and the speed of light simultaneously."
General relativity,"[{'Variable definition': 'Gravity', 'Variable value': 'Curvature of spacetime'}, {'Variable definition': 'Mass and energy', 'Variable value': 'Mass and energy affecting spacetime curvature'}]","General relativity represents gravity as the curvature of spacetime, where mass and energy affect the curvature, thus representing the values of gravity, mass, and energy simultaneously."
Quantum superposition,"[{'Variable definition': 'Particle state', 'Variable value': 'Multiple states simultaneously'}, {'Variable definition': 'Measurement', 'Variable value': 'Collapse to a single state upon measurement'}]","Quantum superposition represents particles existing in multiple states simultaneously, which collapses to a single state upon measurement, thus representing the values of both particle state and measurement simultaneously."
