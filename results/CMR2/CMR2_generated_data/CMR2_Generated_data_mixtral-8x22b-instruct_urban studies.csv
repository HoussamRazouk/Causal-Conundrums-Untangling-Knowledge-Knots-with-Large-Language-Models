Interaction value,Variable values,Explanation
Suburban Sprawl,"[{'Variable definition': 'Urbanization Pattern', 'Variable value': 'Dispersed Urban Growth'}, {'Variable definition': 'Land Use', 'Variable value': 'Low-density Residential and Commercial Development'}]","Suburban Sprawl represents the simultaneous occurrence of dispersed urban growth and low-density residential and commercial development. This pattern of urbanization is characterized by the expansion of urban areas into surrounding rural landscapes, resulting in a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial land uses."
Gentrification,"[{'Variable definition': 'Neighborhood Change', 'Variable value': 'Rapid Increase in Property Values'}, {'Variable definition': 'Demographic Shift', 'Variable value': 'Influx of Higher-income Residents'}]",Gentrification is an interaction value that represents the simultaneous occurrence of a rapid increase in property values and an influx of higher-income residents in a neighborhood. This process often leads to the displacement of lower-income residents and changes in the neighborhood's character and demographics.
Urban Heat Island Effect,"[{'Variable definition': 'Urban Climate', 'Variable value': 'Elevated Temperatures'}, {'Variable definition': 'Land Cover', 'Variable value': 'Predominance of Impervious Surfaces'}]","The Urban Heat Island Effect is an interaction value that represents the simultaneous occurrence of elevated temperatures in urban areas and the predominance of impervious surfaces. This phenomenon is caused by the modification of land cover in urban areas, which leads to increased heat absorption and reduced heat dissipation."
Transit-Oriented Development,"[{'Variable definition': 'Urban Planning', 'Variable value': 'Concentration of Development around Transit Stations'}, {'Variable definition': 'Transportation', 'Variable value': 'Access to Multiple Modes of Transportation'}]","Transit-Oriented Development is an interaction value that represents the simultaneous occurrence of the concentration of development around transit stations and access to multiple modes of transportation. This type of development aims to create compact, walkable communities that reduce reliance on private vehicles and promote sustainable transportation options."
Green Infrastructure,"[{'Variable definition': 'Urban Ecosystem Services', 'Variable value': 'Provision of Ecosystem Services'}, {'Variable definition': 'Urban Design', 'Variable value': 'Integration of Natural Elements into Built Environment'}]","Green Infrastructure is an interaction value that represents the simultaneous occurrence of the provision of ecosystem services and the integration of natural elements into the built environment. This approach to urban design aims to create resilient and sustainable cities by incorporating green spaces, such as parks, green roofs, and bioswales, into the urban fabric."
Smart City Initiatives,"[{'Variable definition': 'Urban Governance', 'Variable value': 'Data-driven Decision Making'}, {'Variable definition': 'Technology', 'Variable value': 'Integration of Information and Communication Technologies'}]","Smart City Initiatives are an interaction value that represents the simultaneous occurrence of data-driven decision making and the integration of information and communication technologies in urban governance. This approach to urban management aims to improve the efficiency, sustainability, and livability of cities by leveraging technology and data."
Urban Agriculture,"[{'Variable definition': 'Food Production', 'Variable value': 'Local Food Production'}, {'Variable definition': 'Land Use', 'Variable value': 'Agricultural Activities within Urban Areas'}]","Urban Agriculture is an interaction value that represents the simultaneous occurrence of local food production and agricultural activities within urban areas. This practice aims to increase food security, promote sustainable land use, and create green spaces within cities."
Adaptive Reuse,"[{'Variable definition': 'Historic Preservation', 'Variable value': 'Preservation of Historic Buildings'}, {'Variable definition': 'Urban Development', 'Variable value': 'Repurposing of Existing Structures'}]",Adaptive Reuse is an interaction value that represents the simultaneous occurrence of the preservation of historic buildings and the repurposing of existing structures for new uses. This approach to urban development aims to maintain the historic character of a city while adapting to changing needs and demands.
Mixed-Use Development,"[{'Variable definition': 'Land Use', 'Variable value': 'Combination of Residential, Commercial, and Other Uses'}, {'Variable definition': 'Urban Form', 'Variable value': 'Compact and Walkable Urban Areas'}]","Mixed-Use Development is an interaction value that represents the simultaneous occurrence of a combination of residential, commercial, and other uses within a compact and walkable urban area. This type of development aims to create vibrant, diverse, and sustainable neighborhoods by integrating different land uses and promoting pedestrian activity."
Urban Resilience,"[{'Variable definition': 'Disaster Risk Reduction', 'Variable value': 'Reduction of Vulnerability to Natural Hazards'}, {'Variable definition': 'Urban Planning', 'Variable value': 'Incorporation of Resilience Principles into Urban Design'}]","Urban Resilience is an interaction value that represents the simultaneous occurrence of the reduction of vulnerability to natural hazards and the incorporation of resilience principles into urban design. This approach to urban planning aims to create cities that can withstand, adapt to, and recover from the impacts of natural disasters and other shocks and stresses."
