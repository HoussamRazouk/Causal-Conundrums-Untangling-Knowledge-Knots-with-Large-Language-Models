falling rates,contractionary policy,False,True,,Interest Rates,mixtral-8x22b-instruct,mixtral-8x22b-instruct,finance,"Both texts refer to the same causal variable, which is Interest Rates. Falling rates indicate a decrease in interest rates, while a contractionary policy is a monetary policy action taken by central banks to decrease the money supply, often by raising interest rates. However, in this context, 'contractionary policy' can also refer to a decrease in interest rates when compared to an expansionary policy. Therefore, both texts can be considered as referring to the same causal variable, Interest Rates."
