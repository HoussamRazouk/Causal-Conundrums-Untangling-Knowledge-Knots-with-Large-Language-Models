  "Variables values": ["Real-time Systems": "Present", "Concurrency": "Present"],
  "Explanation": "The text describes a vulnerability in operating systems that is related to both real-time systems and concurrency. Real-time systems are present because the Time of Check to Time of Use (TOCTTOU) vulnerability is a concern in systems that require real-time responses. Concurrency is also present because the TOCTTOU vulnerability arises from the race condition between the time of check and the time of use, which is a concurrency issue."
